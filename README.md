# JMMS Sender
I have created this tool for test MM7 interface of ericsson VASP API

This tool is very usefull in telco company that use this kind of MMSC

I enclose all the source I have written and all the .jar that you need to send a MMS with Ericsson MMSC.

JMMS Sender is written in Java 1.4.2. and updated to works with JDK 11.

I believe that this program will also work with all JDK versions, but you need to recompile it.

Use this program in Linux, Windows, AIX, Sun Solaris or all environment you want.
